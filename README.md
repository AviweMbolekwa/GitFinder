## Frontend Mentor Challenge: Github User Search App
![mockup](/assets/readme/mockup.jpg)

- GitFinder is a web application aimed at leveraging the GitHub Users API to retrieve and present user profile information from the GitHub platform. This endeavor aligns with the objective of creating a seamless and informative user experience, allowing individuals and organizations to access and visualize GitHub users' details efficiently.

- GitFinder is a solution that I developed for a challenge that I found on the "Frontend Mentor" website. Click [GitHub User Search App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6) to see the challenge.
